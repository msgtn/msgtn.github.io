###### The Blossom robot in its current covered form (top) and its inner frame (bottom). 

I developed Blossom, an [open-source social robot platform](https://github.com/msgtn/r0b0/blob/main/docs/blsm.md), for my [PhD at Cornell](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LzEyxcsAAAAJ).
[Blossom was designed as a critique](https://spectrum.ieee.org/blossom-a-creative-handmade-approach-to-social-robotics-from-cornell-and-google#toggle-gdpr) of [stereotypical mass-manufactured white-and-black LED-illuminated commercial robots](https://www.google.com/search?q=robot&hl=en&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjMpp3j_Or-AhVZFlkFHRK7AF0Q0pQJegQIAxAC).
I — and the many students and collaborators whom I had the pleasure of working with — developed Blossom as a [robot construction kit](https://github.com/hrc2/blossom-public), [AI research platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP8qEnDWCH0), and [telepresence device](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M7a0qXfySc). [My presentation at the RoboPhilosophy conference sums up the Blossom project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si2D6TpGEFE&feature=youtu.be), which is [continued](https://magazine.viterbi.usc.edu/fall-2023/whats-next/small-ally-big-impact/) by [other](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/30359) [researchers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17937).
My current ["rebuild" of the platform](/rebuild_of_blossom) has refactored the hardware and software for improved modularity and ongoing development.
