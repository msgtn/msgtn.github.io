I am a [PhD graduate from Cornell University](/research), where I developed Blossom, an [open-source social robot platform](https://github.com/hrc2/blossom-public).
[Blossom was designed as a critique of mass-manufactured white-and-black LED-illuminated commercial robots](https://spectrum.ieee.org/blossom-a-creative-handmade-approach-to-social-robotics-from-cornell-and-google#toggle-gdpr).
I worked on Blossom as an [AI research platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP8qEnDWCH0) and [telepresence device](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M7a0qXfySc), and others have created their own Blossoms for their own applications.
[My presentation at the RoboPhilosophy conference sums up the Blossom project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si2D6TpGEFE&feature=youtu.be), which is still ongoing.

My papers - and whatever metrics search engineers deem important - are available on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LzEyxcsAAAAJ).
