I am [Michael Suguitan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LzEyxcsAAAAJ).

I am a PhD graduate from Cornell University, where I developed Blossom, an open-source social robot platform. Blossom was designed for accessibility: its hardware and software is open-source, and several researchers have created their own versions of Blossom. [My presentation at the RoboPhilosophy conference sums up the Blossom project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si2D6TpGEFE&feature=youtu.be), which is still ongoing.

Prior to Cornell, I studied mechanical engineering and programming at NC State. My graduation cap was kinda famous. My past work experiences include NASA MSFC, Honda Research Institute Japan, and Facebook AI Research. 

<!-- Blossom is a platform for researching generative behaviors through deep neural networks. Through encoder-decoder networks, Blossom 'remixes' user-made movements into autonomously generated behaviors.

Blossom also acts as a telepresence platform, controlled via a smartphone's mobile browser and the remote user's physical movement. -->



Outside of work, I build stuff,
photograph stuff,
and play stuff.
