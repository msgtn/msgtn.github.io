I [make](/works),
[photograph](/image),
and [musick](/music).

I am an engineer and researcher skilled in mechatronics design and prototyping, front- and back-end software development, and research and development for artificial intelligence and user interaction.
I earned my [PhD from Cornell University](/research), where I developed Blossom, an [open-source social robot platform](https://github.com/msgtn/r0b0). 
Prior to Cornell, I studied mechanical engineering and programming at [NC State](/asme), where I led [our robotics team](https://www.mae.ncsu.edu/2016/02/09/students-win-2015-asme-student-design-competition/) to [first place in an international competition](https://www.asme.org/topics-resources/society-news/asme-news/studentdesigned-rescue-robots-face-imece-2015).
My [graduation caps](/gradcap) were [kinda](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=280843082514460) [known](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/4gzqs6/a_robotic_automatic_wireless_selfturning/).

I am currently designing human-robot interactions and developing software at [Fauna Robotics](https://faunarobotics.com/).
My past work experiences include R&D for electromagnetic actuators at [NASA MSFC](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/home/index.html), affective robot AI research at [Honda Research Institute Japan](http://www.jp.honda-ri.com), and multimodal robot AI research at [Facebook AI Research](https://ai.facebook.com/research/).
I am also a (never-)alum of the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=edb5580c1c1d0f7739dbf081a76ca2c3), a self-directed technical sabbatical only describable as "a writing retreat for programmers."
More information is available on my [CV](/assets/pdf/msuguitan_cv.pdf); projects are available [on this site](/works) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/msgtn).

This website is graciously built on [Paul Le's Millennial jekyll theme](https://github.com/LeNPaul/Millennial).
