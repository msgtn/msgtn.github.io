I am a [PhD graduate from Cornell University](/research), where I developed Blossom, an [open-source social robot platform](https://github.com/hrc2/blossom-public).
[Blossom was designed as a critique of mass-manufactured white-and-black LED-illuminated commercial robots](https://spectrum.ieee.org/blossom-a-creative-handmade-approach-to-social-robotics-from-cornell-and-google#toggle-gdpr).
I developed Blossom as a [robot construction kit](https://github.com/hrc2/blossom-public), [AI research platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP8qEnDWCH0), and [telepresence device](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M7a0qXfySc), and others have created their own Blossoms for their own applications.
[My presentation at the RoboPhilosophy conference sums up the Blossom project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si2D6TpGEFE&feature=youtu.be), which is still ongoing.

Prior to Cornell, I studied mechanical engineering and programming at [NC State](/asme). My [graduation caps](/gradcap) were [kinda](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=280843082514460) [famous](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/4gzqs6/a_robotic_automatic_wireless_selfturning/). My past work experiences include [NASA MSFC](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/home/index.html), [Honda Research Institute Japan](http://www.jp.honda-ri.com), and [Facebook AI Research](https://ai.facebook.com/research/). 

Outside of work, I [build stuff](/eng),
[photograph stuff](/image),
and [play music stuff](/music).
