This web shooter project was an attempt to learn more about electronics towards an interesting application.
I was primarily inspired by [LaserGadgets' version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXp0XQYJAT4).
The system is a wrist-mounted coilgun with a boost converter that charges a capacitor bank to fire an iron nail.
The nail is tied to a fishing line harvested from a toy Spider-Man fishing pole.
The interface is three buttons in the palm: one to charge the capacitor bank, one to fire the nail, and another to reel the motor.
