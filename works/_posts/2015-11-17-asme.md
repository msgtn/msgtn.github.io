In my senior year, I was the team leader for one of the NCSU ASME Design Team subteams.
The design challenge, titled 'Robots for Relief,' was to create a system to deliver a payload of grains through several obstacles, including water, sand, and high steps.
The challenge imposed constraints on the size of the robot, the capacity of the power source, and a time limit on the course.
<!-- We designed and built a tank-treaded robot. -->
Our design used tank treads for wider weight distribution for the sand, two lever arms for climbing, and a simple 3D-printed container for dropping the payload.
