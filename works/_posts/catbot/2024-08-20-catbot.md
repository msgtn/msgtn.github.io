CatBot is a window-mounted gadget that detects stray cats. 
CatBot monitors a scene with computer vision and sends text notifications of cat sightings.
CatBot also deters birds, for whom cat food is dangerous, with an actuator that taps the window upon bird sightings.
The project's code is available [here](https://github.com/msgtn/catbot).

# Motivation
I lived in Connecticut for a year, next to West Rock state park.
There were many stray cats around so we started putting food out in our backyard.
Sometimes we'd catch a glimpse of a partaking stray, but I wanted to automate notifications of sightings and record pictures of the cats.
The strays were also extremely skittish; even us moving closer to the window was enough to scare them away.
The resulting system is similar to a homebrewed [Bird Buddy](https://mybirdbuddy.com).

# Implementation

*CatBot implementation.*

CatBot is built on a [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero/) and uses an embedded camera and computer vision to detect cats.
The camera is a standard Raspberry Pi camera with a thin [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) server to serve images.
Because the Pi Zero is too under-powered to deploy a computer vision model, a separate [Pi 5](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/) requests images from the Zero and performs object detection with a small [Faster R-CNN MobileNet model](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/faster_rcnn.html).
The Pi 5 also runs a [Twillo](https://www.twilio.com/) client to send the cat images to my phone number.

*Bare CatBot hardware. Not suspicious at all.*

Unfortunately, exposed cat food also attracts a lot of birds.
Cat food is unhealthy and potentially dangerous for birds, so we needed a method to keep them away.
We tried a simple shirt-on-a-stick scarecrow, but it scared away both the birds and the cats.

The birds are even more skittish than the cats, so much so that lightly tapping on the window is enough for them to flee.
I came up with a solution that also let me shove a motor into the gadget and earn the label of "robot": a [Tower Pro micro servo](https://www.towerpro.com.tw/product/sg90-7/) with a chopstick as the arm taps on the window to scare the birds away.
If the Pi 5 detects a bird, it sends a request to the Pi Zero actuate the motor.

# Results
These are some of the images CatBot collected from 2024/01—05.
 
## Mangy

{% include carousel.html height="80" unit="%" number="3" %}

Mangy definitely looked the most feral of the lot. It had a piercing gaze and a beautiful orange-black-white coat.

## Scruffy

{% include carousel.html height="80" unit="%" number="7" %}

Scruffy always looked like it had just been caught in some rain. It had a bit of a droopy face that reminds me of shy feral cats that live in dark and damp crawl spaces.

## Mittens

{% include carousel.html height="80" unit="%" number="4" %}

Mittens was named so for its perfectly demarcated white paws. I once enticed it to laze on the porch with some leftover deli-sliced chicken.

## Creamsicle

{% include carousel.html height="80" unit="%" number="2" %}

Creamsicle was probably the most regular patron of the porch, though so skittish that we never got any closer than the window.

## Pinay II

{% include carousel.html height="80" unit="%" number="5" %}

Pinay II had a cookies-and-cream coat that reminded me of my own cat, Pinay.

## Chonker
{% include carousel.html height="80" unit="%" number="1" %}

Chonker was overly well fed. It had a collar but we never figured out its owner.

## Raccoons

{% include carousel.html height="80" unit="%" number="6" %}

We avoided leaving food out overnight lest we attract raccoons.

## Timelapse
I also created a timelapse with an archive of raw images from the Pi Zero.
The images span from 2024/01—05, with some patches when the system was offline.
The image rate also varies as the image request frequency was adjusted during development.

# Conclusion
We've since left the neighborhood and the cats, so CatBot is no longer active.
We advised the neighbors and new tenants to take care of the cats if they can.
It's amazing how simple yet effective this project was, which was mostly just integration.
CatBot illustrates the accessibility of homebrewing open-source alternatives to commercial closed-source products.
