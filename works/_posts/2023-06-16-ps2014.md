The infamous [IKEA PS2014 "Death Star" lamp](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/ikea-ps-2014-pendant-lamp-black-20531748/#content) is practically begging to be robotized, so I did.
[Many others](https://ikeahackers.net/2016/03/automated-ikea-ps-2014-pendant-lamp.html) [have had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrMKSYkm5MY) [the same idea](https://www.instructables.com/Automated-IKEA-PS-2014/).
My implementation is not particularly novel apart from the use of Dynamixel smart motors and simplifying the installation.
The modification is a 3D-printed screw-drive actuation mechanism and is non-invasive for reversibility.

## Implementation
I provide implementation details for others to hack their own lamps.

### Hardware

![Exploded view of the actuation mechanism](../assets/img/ps2014_exploded.png)
*Exploded view of the modification. I affixed the motor to the main 'spine' of the lamp body with a 3D-printed motor-body mount (top center). The screw-drive actuator is a 1/4" 6" bolt mounted to the motor horn with a 3D-printed bolt-motor mount (left). The actuator raises the actuating 'scaffold' with another 3D-printed component (bottom).*

The lamp's mechanism is really neat: linear actuation of the 'spine' swings the panels open.
The mechanism reminds me of the [wing-opening mechanism from the Master Grade Wing Gundam Zero](http://dalong.net/reviews/mg/m75/p/m75_06.jpg) — a robot of unparalleled nostalgia for anyone who watched Toonami circa 2000.
I initially tried a winch mechanism to 'reel' up the moving component — I dubbed it the 'scaffold' — but it proved too heavy for the [Dynamixel XL330 motor](https://www.robotis.us/dynamixel-xl330-m077-t/) I constrained myself to using.
I pivoted to a screw-drive mechanism to make the load of the scaffold parallel to the motor's axis, thus relieving the motor from the torque caused by the scaffold's weight.
I specifically used coarse-thread hardware to gain linear velocity, as the screw-drive's linear travel is proportional to the steepness of the thread angle.

Although the XL330 proved slower than motors used in other modifications, it provides a great simplification of the electronics.
Other implementations required limit switches to sense the endpoints of the scaffold's actuation to prevent damage to the lamp body.
The XL330 features an extended position control mode for ±256 revolutions with position sensing, which enabled me to define the endpoints in software instead of requiring hardware sensors.
Another plus for the XL330 is that it operates at 5V; while this means it has a lower top speed than higher-voltage motors, it can be powered from a simple 5V supply like a USB port on a computer or wall charger.

This list covers the items I used:
- **Motor and controller**: Dynamixel XL330 (the M288 or M077 are identical externally, though the M077 has a faster gearbox), Dynamixel U2D2 communication board, power connection (e.g. a USB breakout board). [A guide for wiring this motor interface which I use for other projects is available here](https://github.com/psychomugs/r0b0/blob/main/docs/wiring.md). ADD PICTURE OF ACTUAL COMPONENT
- **Hardware**: 1/4" 6" coarse-thread bolt and nut, M2 bolts and nuts (for the motor mount: 20mm x1, 10mm x2, nut x1; for the 1/4" screw mount: 4mm x2, 8mm x2, nut x2)
- **Printed components**: Motor-body mount, bolt-motor mount, scaffold actuator mount. [Files are downloadable here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6089929).

### Software

*If you run into any issues, please submit an issue to the repository.*

I used my [`r0b0` library](http://github.com/psychomugs/r0b0) for this 'rig,' designated `ps2014` after the official name of the lamp.
Beyond controlling the lamp from the command line, I created a simple browser page to enable remote open-close control, even from non-local networks.

First, clone the `r0b0` repository and follow the installation instructions:
```
git clone https://github.com/psychomugs/r0b0
```

Once the repository is installed, we need to set the motor to its extended position control mode and calibrate the endpoints.
Start the `ps2014` configuration for the lamp, which contains both the `DynamixelGadget` controller for the lamp and a minimal web interface through a `Page` (information on the `r0b0` architecture can be found on the repo's README, and I have to acknowledge [rdiverdi's Dynamixel wrapper library for simplifying the motor control](https://github.com/rdiverdi/dynamixel_python)):
```
python3 start.py ps2014
```

The script will `breakpoint()` so we can use the command line interface to get motor information.
The start script will assign `ps2014` to the `DynamixelGadget` object from which we can get the motor object, affectionately denoted `'spine'`, then turn off the motor's torque to make it compliant:
```
spine = ps2014.dxl_dict['spine']
spine.set_torque_enable(False)
```

Then, we can set the operating mode to 'extended position' to enable multi-turn position control.
The large range of the Dynamixel's extended position mode — from ±1,048,575 — is really useful.
```
spine.set_operating_mode(4)
```

Then, manually spin the motor until the lamp is fully open / 'exploded' with the inner structure at its bottommost point.
Record the `present_position` value; mine was 180,000:
```
spine.get_present_position()
```
Spin the motor in the opposite direction to close the lamp and bring the inner structure to its topmost point, then repeat the position measurement; mine was 450,000. 
We can also turn torque control back on.
```
spine.get_present_position()
spine.set_torque_enable(True)
```

Update `r0b0/rigs/static/ps2014.js` with these values:
```
...
    closeButton.onclick = function() {
    console.log('closeButton');
    socket.emit('button',
        {
            event:'button',
            value:450000,		# update this value
            id:socket.id
        });
}

openButton.onclick = function() {
    console.log('openButton');
    socket.emit('button',
        {
            event:'button',
            value:180000,		# and this one
            id:socket.id,
        });
}
...
```

Note that these values may change whenever you unplug the motor.

### Minimal interface
In a browser, navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.
The buttons on this page will emit the `button` events to the `ps2014` app above, which translates the button values into the position values we calibrated.
For remote control from an outside network, [you could set up an ngrok tunnel](https://github.com/psychomugs/r0b0/blob/main/docs/blsm.md) and have your friend control your lamp from afar in a remote communication system similar to [Gaver's 'Feather, Scent, and Shaker' project](https://cfacaa.human.cornell.edu/dea.arl/linked%20docs/Feather%20Scent%20and%20Shaker.pdf).

## Conclusion
This was a fun hackathon-esque weekend project that covered the full-stack of robotics: mechatronic design, software control, and user interfacing.
Future work involves how to persist the functionality either as a standalone device (e.g. with a Pi Zero) or connected to a local server.
I imagine this being part of a larger network of locally connected devices.
