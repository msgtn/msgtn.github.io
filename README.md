# Scratch
I would like to structure this site in a way that resembles a room.
Inspired by mind palaces and anti-dualism, I believe that a mentally logical structure would also be physically logical.

```
+------------+
|i|    +--b--|
|-+          |
|     +-+    |
|-+   |c|    |
|m|   +-+    |
|p|        \ |
+--------   \+
i = me
b = books
p = photo
m = music
r = robot
c = craft
```
