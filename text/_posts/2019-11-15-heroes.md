I once met Yoshiyuki Tomino, the creator of the mecha anime Mobile Suit Gundam.
He also produced Voltes V, another super-robot show that was a huge cultural phenomenon in my native Philippines[^0].
As a roboticist who based many life decisions on these formative works, it's needless to say that Tomino had a great influence on my life's trajectory.

I won a lottery for a signing opportunity with Tomino at AnimeNYC 2019.
It was obvious to have him sign part of a model kit, so I express-ordered an [MG RX-78-2](https://www.hlj.com/1-100-scale-mg-gundam-rx-78-2-ver-3-0-ban983655) and chose to bring the shield.
At the signing table, I told Tomino[^1] how I had been watching Gundam and building the model kits since I was young, leading to becoming a (then-)grad student doing [robotics research](https://msgtn.io/research).

He let out a regretful chuckle and planted his forehead on the table.

I profusely thanked him, and he wished me good luck as I left.
Maybe facedesking was Tomino expressing disappointment that, again, someone has missed the anti-war story[^2] for the shiny robot toys and could be actively contributing towards the real-life war machines[^3] he was commenting on.
Whatever the reason, memorable lessons deny explanation.

[^0]: Filipino broadcaster GMA even [adapted the story into a live-action teledrama](https://www.gmanetwork.com/fullepisodes/home/voltes_v_legacy).

[^1]: In overly rehearsed Japanese, to the point of feeling faint practicing in line.

[^3]: A great deal of robotics work is related to and funded by defense, though what I do is much closer to the companion robot Haro.

[^2]: At an earlier post-panel Q&A, someone mentioned that they became a fighter pilot because of Gundam. Tomino looked more disappointed with that guy than with me.
