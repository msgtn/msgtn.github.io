###### Inverted panorama of Cayuga Lake, 2022


*It’s the sound of failure: so much modern art is the sound of things going out of control, of a medium pushing to its limits and breaking apart.*

*One day, we will regret so much accuracy and artists will try to create chance accidents deliberately. Kodachrome film changes colours of its own accord, in the most unexpected way. To a certain extent, it creates. We have to accept this as if it were a painter’s interpretation and accept the surprises. It doesn’t show what I want, but what the camera and the chemical baths want. It’s another world where it’s essential to forget the one we live in.*
