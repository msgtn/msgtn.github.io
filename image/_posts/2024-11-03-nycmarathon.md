These are photos of the 2024 NYC Marathon, taken on the [MPi](/mpi).
I ran the marathon in 2019 and it was the most painful experience of my life, until I dislocated my elbow at the LES skatepark.
I kept up with the three-hour pace group until after the Queensboro Bridge, coming up on mile 17, when my left calf cramped and I had to hobble for the remaining 9 miles to finish in [3:28:04](https://results.nyrr.org/event/M2019/finishers#search=Michael%2520Suguitan&page=1).
In hindsight, I attribute the cramps to:
- 1) doing long training runs on a gravel trail instead of pavement,
- 2) a shortened training period due to having just moved back from interning in Japan, and
- 3) a weaker left calf from regular-stance skating and popping more frequently from the right leg.

This was my first year as a spectator and it was really inspiring to watch, so much so that I'm considering going back to a more intentional running practice.
